<br>
 River Satluj, like the Indus and Brahmaputra, is one of the few rivers that cuts through the Himalayas. It enters Himachal at Shipki La and passes through a deep gorge in Kinnaur and leaves the state at Bhakra in a westward flow.Ridges of the mountains on the eastern flank of Satluj divide north India into the Indus and Ganga basins. Shimla, the stateâ€™s capital city, is located along this ridge line that stretches into Kinnaur. From the east side of Shimla, rainwater and snow melt flows into the Bay of Bengal and from the western side it end up in the Arabian Sea.

Sheltered by the ranges, rivers and their feeding tributary streams have carved out some of the most serene, scenic and fertile valleys. The high mountain desert valley of Spiti, the scenic Sangla valley of Kinnaur, the charming Beas valley of Kullu-Manali and Mandi, the indulgent land of Kangra valley, the aesthetically cut out Chamba valley and Lahaul valley, crowded with some of the biggest glaciers in the entire Himalayas, is the backdrop of Himachal Pradesh, a geography as exciting as it can get.
