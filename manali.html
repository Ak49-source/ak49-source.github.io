A gift of the Himalayas to the world, Manali is a beautiful township nestled in the picturesque Beas River valley. It is a rustic enclave known for its cool climate and snow-capped mountains, offering respite to tourists escaping scorching heat of the plains. The tourism industry in Manali started booming only in the early 20th century, mainly because of its natural bounties and salubrious climate. 
<br><br>
Once a sleepy village, the modern town cocooned in its rich cultural heritage and age-old traditions is now one of the most popular destinations of India. The place is a classic blend of peace and tranquility which makes it a haven for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts, who want to get off the main tourist trails and experience nature up close. 
<br><br>
The glacial water of River Beas after rushing down the slopes of Rohtang Pass allows adventure sport activities of rowing, white water rafting and river crossing as it meanders through the valley from Manali to Kullu.
<br><br>
The open valley with terraced fields dotted with hotels and resorts has tourists converge on this township in summer from April to July and in autumn to early winter from October to December. 
<br><br>
If you have ever imagined of sitting by the gushing water of a snow-fed stream, or waking up to a glorious sunrise with breathtaking views to soak in, Manali is the place to be.

<strong>Clothing Essentials:</strong>With increasing altitude, the temperature falls in the valley and weather can change very abruptly in this region. Thunderstorms and sudden snowfalls do cause a sharp drop in temperature turning an otherwise warm day into a cold one in a matter of minutes. Woolens are essential when visiting Manali. In summers, light woolens with a scarf for the evenings will have you prepared should it get chilly.
