For sheer geographic diversity, few places in the world are as richly endowed as Himachal Pradesh. Rivers cutting through deep gorges, placid mountain lakes, thick forests, acres of scree, snow capped mountains piercing the skyline, sheep scattered like cotton fluffs over alpine pastures; all excite the spirit for outdoor activities, sports and adventure. A stress buster or a challenging adventure, for the beginner or an expert, there is an activity, a sport, an adventure for one and all out there. All it demands is a reasonable level of fitness and a willing spirit.
